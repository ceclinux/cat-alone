## Mirroring
### Misconception of negotiation
It's a common misconception of negotiation is that you need to have an argument, come prepared and state all the reasons people should make the deal with you.
But this is not the case in real life effective negotiation. Instead, you need to know what other people think, help them clarify what they want, make them feel engaged and make they think they want to work with you to get what they want.

### What does Mirroring Do
1. It makes people feel engaged, involved, which consequently helps you get to tease out information that you won't get otherwise.
2. It helps you gather information.
3. It helps you to build rapport with other people. There's a saying goes "Interesting people are interested". People love to be encouraged to go on.
4. It helps you get to your goal: to let the other side to have your way.

### How to mirror
1. Simple repetition of last 1-3 words of what the other side say
2. It makes the other person think you listen to what they say carefully


### Mirror confrontational people
It's common in business negotiation where you want to make situation less hostile and more collaborative. Mirroring your counterpart help to avoid confrontation. It takes 2 people to fight. Be nice, use a great tone of voice and genuine curiosity to listen to the other side and seek for collaboration.

### Silence of golden
It's important to stop and let the other person talk after mirroring.

## Emotion Labelling
Labels are verbal observations. It triggers contemplation if your label is correct, and it deactivates the negativity if there's any. It helps to build up a trust-based influence.

### Steps of labelling
1. Be aware of the emotion or the dynamic from the other side
2. Label it, and fill in the black, e.g. "You sounds like _", "You seems like _", "It feels like _", etc.
3. Try to build a trust-based influence.

### How NOT to label
1. Don't start with "What I'm hearing is ..." otherwise you make people feel you are interested in YOUR perspectives than theirs.
2. Resist your urge to explain your thoughts after labeling or talk. Let the other side think. Let it trigger the type of contemplation you intend to trigger.
3. Even you have a second or better label, let the first one sink in before providing a new one.


### Label More Than Once
1. Labels can be accumulative.
2. A lack of response to a negative label is a good sign that you are on the right track. You just need to do more in the next steps.


### Reinforce Positive Emotions
Find the real positive emotion under the surface, label it, and you'll reinforce the positive emotion.

### Mirroring and Labelling in Tandem
1. Mirrors help you get closer to the dynamic or the emotions the other side is feeling.
2. You can mirror the response of a response to your label, to get more information, or expand on something you are interested in or want to confirm.
